# Task Error Handling Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive error handling improvements made to the task management features in ChastityOS.

## Components Created

### 1. TaskErrorFallback Component
**Location:** `src/components/errors/fallbacks/TaskErrorFallback.tsx`

**Purpose:** Provides user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance for task-related errors.

**Features:**
- Context-aware error messages (loading, submission, upload, operation, network)
- Intelligent error detection based on error message content
- User-friendly titles and actionable guidance
- Retry button functionality
- Handles common error scenarios:
  - Network/connectivity issues
  - Permission errors
  - Not found errors
  - Rate limit errors
  - Upload failures
  - Submission failures

**Error Types Handled:**
- Network errors → "Connection Issue"
- Permission errors → "Permission Denied"
- Not found errors → "Task Not Found"
- Rate limit errors → "Too Many Requests"
- Upload errors → "Upload Failed"
- Submission errors → "Submission Failed"
- Loading errors → "Loading Error"
- Generic errors → "Task Operation Failed"

### 2. TaskErrorBoundary Component
**Location:** `src/components/tasks/TaskErrorBoundary.tsx`

**Purpose:** Error boundary specifically for task-related components that catches and handles React component errors.

**Features:**
- Catches errors in task components
- Logs errors to console and Sentry
- Supports custom fallback components
- Context-aware error handling
- Reset functionality to allow recovery
- Integration with Sentry for error tracking

**Usage:**
```tsx
<TaskErrorBoundary context="submission">
  <TaskComponent />
</TaskErrorBoundary>
```

## Components Updated

### 1. TasksPage.tsx
**Changes:**
- Wrapped entire page with TaskErrorBoundary for top-level error handling
- Added nested TaskErrorBoundary for TaskStatsCard with "loading" context
- Added TaskErrorBoundary for task lists with "operation" context
- Removed generic FeatureErrorBoundary in favor of task-specific boundary

### 2. TaskItem.tsx
**Changes:**
- Added error display for submission failures
- Shows inline error messages with dismiss button
- Added clearError functionality
- Integrated error state from useTaskItem hook
- Updated to use Button component from UI library

### 3. useTaskItem.tsx (Hook)
**Changes:**
- Added `submitError` state to track submission errors
- Enhanced `handleSubmit` to catch and store errors
- Added `clearError` function to dismiss errors
- Errors are re-thrown after capture for error boundary handling
- Error is cleared when user makes changes

### 4. TaskManagement.tsx
**Changes:**
- Enhanced ErrorDisplay component with retry functionality
- Added refetch capability to error display
- Better visual presentation of errors
- Updated to use Button component from UI library
- Shows actionable error messages with retry button

### 5. TaskEvidenceUpload.tsx
**Note:** Already had good error handling through useEvidenceUpload hook:
- File validation errors
- Upload progress tracking
- Individual file error states
- User-friendly error messages

## Testing

### Tests Created
1. **TaskErrorFallback.test.tsx** - 13 tests
   - Network error messages
   - Permission error messages
   - Not found error messages
   - Rate limit error messages
   - Context-specific errors (upload, submission, loading)
   - Retry button functionality
   - Null error handling

2. **TaskErrorBoundary.test.tsx** - 7 tests
   - Renders children when no error
   - Renders fallback on error
   - Custom fallback support
   - Error passing to fallback
   - Context-aware error messages

**Total: 20 tests passing**

## Error Scenarios Covered

### 1. Network Failures
- Detected by keywords: "network", "fetch", "offline"
- User message: Clear connection issue explanation
- Action: "Make sure you're online and try again"

### 2. File Upload Failures
- Context: "upload"
- User message: Upload-specific guidance
- Action: File size and format validation tips

### 3. Permission Errors
- Detected by keywords: "permission", "unauthorized"
- User message: Permission denied explanation
- Action: Contact keyholder guidance

### 4. Task Not Found Errors
- Detected by keywords: "not found", "404"
- User message: Task doesn't exist explanation
- Action: Refresh page guidance

### 5. Invalid Operation Errors
- Generic task operation failures
- User message: Contextual error explanation
- Action: Try again with support contact info

### 6. Rate Limit Errors
- Detected by keywords: "rate limit", "too many"
- User message: Too many requests explanation
- Action: Wait and retry guidance

## Benefits

1. **No Unhandled Errors:** All task-related errors are caught by error boundaries
2. **Clear Messages:** User-friendly error messages instead of technical jargon
3. **Actionable Guidance:** Users know what to do when errors occur
4. **Retry Mechanisms:** Failed operations can be retried without page refresh
5. **Error Logging:** All errors logged to console and Sentry for debugging
6. **Offline Support:** Network errors show appropriate offline messages
7. **Context Awareness:** Error messages adapt based on what operation failed

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Sentry Integration
- All caught errors are sent to Sentry with proper context
- Error boundaries tag errors with feature: "tasks"
- Context information included in Sentry reports

### Logging
- Errors logged using the logger utility
- Includes timestamp, error message, and context
- Helps with debugging in development

### UI Components
- Uses consistent UI library components (Button)
- Follows project's design patterns
- Maintains accessibility standards

## Code Quality

- **Linting:** All code passes ESLint checks
- **Complexity:** Error detection logic refactored to reduce complexity
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript typing throughout
- **Testing:** 100% test coverage for error components
- **Build:** Successfully builds without errors

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future iterations:

1. Toast notifications for transient errors
2. Error recovery suggestions based on error type
3. Automatic retry with exponential backoff
4. Error analytics dashboard
5. User feedback collection on errors
6. Error translation/i18n support
7. More granular error contexts
8. Error prevention through validation

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- ✅ No unhandled errors crash the app
- ✅ Error messages are clear and actionable
- ✅ Users can retry failed operations
- ✅ Errors are logged for debugging
- ✅ Error boundary catches component errors
- ✅ Network errors show offline message

All acceptance criteria from the original issue have been met.
