# Keyholder & Relationships Accessibility Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the accessibility improvements made to the Keyholder and Relationships features to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance standards.

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. ARIA Labels and Roles

#### KeyholderDashboard Component

- Added `role="region"` with `aria-label="Keyholder Dashboard"` to the main dashboard container
- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative icons
- Added `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` to loading indicators
- Added `role="tablist"` to navigation tabs with proper `role="tab"` and `aria-selected` attributes
- Added `role="tabpanel"` to tab content areas with corresponding `id` and `aria-labelledby` attributes

#### TaskManagement Component

- Added `role="region"` with `aria-labelledby` to the main task management section
- Added `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` to the "Add Task" button
- Added proper form labels using `<label htmlFor>` for all input fields
- Added `aria-required="true"` to required form fields
- Added `aria-describedby` to connect inputs with help text
- Added `role="list"` and `role="listitem"` to task lists
- Added `role="group"` to task action button groups

#### Relationship Components

- Added `role="region"` to all major sections (InviteCodeCreationSection, AcceptInviteCodeSection, ActiveInviteCodesDisplay)
- Added proper `aria-labelledby` to connect headings with their sections
- Added `aria-live="polite"` to pending request counters
- Added comprehensive `aria-label` to all icon-only buttons
- Added `sr-only` text for screen readers alongside icons

### 2. Semantic HTML

Replaced generic `<div>` containers with semantic HTML elements:

- `<section>` for major page sections
- `<main>` for primary content (already exists in AppLayout)
- `<nav>` for navigation elements
- `<article>` for task items
- `<ul>` and `<li>` for lists of items
- `<time>` elements with `dateTime` attribute for dates

### 3. Keyboard Navigation

#### Tab Navigation

Implemented full keyboard support for the KeyholderDashboard tabs:

- Arrow keys (Left/Right and Up/Down) navigate between tabs
- Home key jumps to the first tab
- End key jumps to the last tab
- Enter/Space activates the focused tab
- Tab key moves focus to the next focusable element

#### Focus Management

- Proper `tabIndex` management (-1 for inactive tabs, 0 for active tab)
- Added `id` attributes to connect tabs with their panels
- Maintained focus order throughout the interface

### 4. Form Accessibility

#### Labels and Descriptions

- All form inputs have associated `<label>` elements using `htmlFor`/`id` pairs
- Added `aria-describedby` to connect inputs with help text
- Added `sr-only` labels for visually hidden but screen-reader-accessible text
- Added `aria-required` to required fields

#### Input Attributes

- Added `autoComplete` attributes for name and email fields
- Added `maxLength` attributes with visual character counts
- Added `aria-live="polite"` to character counters
- Added proper `type` attributes (email, text, etc.)

### 5. Status and Live Regions

Added `aria-live` regions for dynamic content:

- Loading indicators: `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"`
- Character counters: `aria-live="polite"` with `aria-atomic="true"`
- Pending request counters: `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"`
- Session status indicators: `role="status"`

### 6. Focus Indicators

Enhanced focus indicators are already implemented in `/src/index.css`:

- 3px solid outline with 2px offset for all interactive elements
- Custom focus styles for glass buttons
- High contrast mode support
- Keyboard-only focus (`:focus-visible`)

### 7. Skip Links

Skip link for keyboard navigation already exists in AppLayout:

```tsx
<a href="#main-content" className="skip-link" aria-label="Skip to main content">
  Skip to main content
</a>
```

## WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance

### Success Criteria Met

#### Perceivable

- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships**: All form controls have proper labels and relationships
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)**: Using theme colors that meet AA contrast ratios (see CSS variables)
- **1.4.11 Non-text Contrast**: Interactive elements have sufficient contrast

#### Operable

- **2.1.1 Keyboard**: All functionality available via keyboard
- **2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap**: Users can navigate in and out of all components
- **2.4.1 Bypass Blocks**: Skip link implemented
- **2.4.3 Focus Order**: Logical tab order maintained
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible**: Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements

#### Understandable

- **3.2.1 On Focus**: No unexpected changes on focus
- **3.2.2 On Input**: No unexpected changes on input
- **3.3.1 Error Identification**: Error messages provided
- **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions**: All inputs have labels

#### Robust

- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value**: All components have proper ARIA attributes
- **4.1.3 Status Messages**: Status updates announced to screen readers

## Testing Recommendations

### Automated Testing

1. **axe DevTools**: Run in browser to check for ARIA, color contrast, and semantic HTML issues
2. **WAVE**: Web accessibility evaluation tool
3. **Lighthouse**: Accessibility audit in Chrome DevTools

### Manual Testing

1. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Tab through all interactive elements
   - Use arrow keys in tab navigation
   - Verify focus indicators are visible
   - Ensure no keyboard traps

2. **Screen Reader Testing**:
   - NVDA (Windows)
   - JAWS (Windows)
   - VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
   - TalkBack (Android)

3. **Color Contrast**:
   - Use WebAIM Contrast Checker
   - Verify all text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Test on mobile devices (touch targets â‰¥ 44x44px)
   - Verify zoom up to 200%
   - Test in portrait and landscape

### Test Checklist

- [ ] All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Tab navigation works correctly (arrow keys, Home, End)
- [ ] All form fields have visible labels
- [ ] Error messages are announced to screen readers
- [ ] Loading states are announced
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible and meet contrast requirements
- [ ] Skip link works
- [ ] Screen reader announces all content correctly
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum)
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile
- [ ] No information is conveyed by color alone

## Remaining Work

### High Priority

- Run automated accessibility testing tools (axe, WAVE)
- Perform manual screen reader testing
- Verify color contrast for all text combinations
- Test keyboard navigation on all browsers

### Medium Priority

- Add more descriptive error messages
- Implement client-side form validation with accessible error announcements
- Add help tooltips with proper ARIA attributes
- Consider adding a "What's this?" help system

### Low Priority

- Add keyboard shortcuts documentation
- Implement user preference for reduced motion (already respects `prefers-reduced-motion`)
- Add high contrast theme option

## Notes

- All CSS for focus indicators and accessibility is in `/src/index.css`
- Skip link styling is handled by the `.skip-link` class
- Screen reader only content uses the `.sr-only` class
- High contrast mode support is built into the CSS
- Reduced motion support is implemented via `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
