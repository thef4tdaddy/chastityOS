## Merge Conflict Resolution Strategy

### Common Conflict Areas

1. **Database Schema**: Multiple PRs modify Firebase/Dexie schemas
2. **Service Layer**: Overlapping service implementations
3. **React Components**: Similar components with different approaches
4. **TypeScript Types**: Type definitions may conflict

### Resolution Approach

```bash
# For each merge:
1. Identify conflicting files
2. Analyze functional differences
3. Prefer the most complete/advanced implementation
4. Document decisions in merge commit

# Example merge process:
git merge origin/pr-branch-name
# If conflicts:
git status  # See conflicted files
# Manually resolve, preferring best-of-breed features
git add resolved-files
git commit -m "Merge PR #XXX: description + resolution notes"
```

### Decision Framework

When choosing between conflicting implementations:

1. **Functionality**: More complete feature set wins
2. **Architecture**: Better long-term maintainability wins
3. **Performance**: More optimized implementation wins
4. **Security**: More secure approach wins
5. **Testing**: Better test coverage wins

## Risk Management

### High Risk Areas

1. **Keyholder System Complexity**: Most complex merger
   - **Mitigation**: Phase 1 focus, extensive testing
   - **Rollback**: Keep individual PR branches

2. **Database Migration**: Multiple schema changes
   - **Mitigation**: Careful migration scripts, backup strategy
   - **Testing**: Test migrations on copies of production data

3. **State Management**: Multiple state systems
   - **Mitigation**: Clear separation between server/client state
   - **Documentation**: Clear state flow documentation

### Medium Risk Areas

1. **Performance**: Merged system may be slower
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing at each phase
   - **Monitoring**: Performance metrics throughout

2. **TypeScript**: Type conflicts across PRs
   - **Mitigation**: Strict type checking early
   - **Resolution**: Consistent type patterns

### Conflict Resolution Process

```bash
# When merge conflicts occur:
1. Document the conflict source (which PRs)
2. Analyze the competing implementations
3. Choose the best approach (using decision framework)
4. Test the resolution thoroughly
5. Document the decision in commit message
```
