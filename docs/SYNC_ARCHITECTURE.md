# Firebase Sync Service and Conflict Resolution Architecture

This document outlines the implementation of the robust bidirectional sync system between Firebase and Dexie with intelligent conflict resolution.

## Overview

The sync system ensures data consistency across devices and offline scenarios by implementing:

- **Bidirectional synchronization** between Firebase (cloud) and Dexie (local IndexedDB)
- **Intelligent conflict resolution** with automatic and manual resolution strategies
- **Offline queue management** for operations performed when offline
- **Real-time listeners** for immediate updates from Firebase
- **User-friendly conflict resolution UI** for manual conflict resolution

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Sync Service (`FirebaseSync`)

The main orchestrator that handles:
- **Upload Operations**: Pushes pending local changes to Firebase
- **Download Operations**: Pulls remote changes from Firebase to local storage
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies conflicts between local and remote data
- **Conflict Resolution**: Applies resolution strategies automatically or queues for manual resolution

```typescript
// Usage
const result = await firebaseSync.syncUserData(userId, {
  conflictResolution: 'auto', // or 'manual'
  collections: ['sessions', 'tasks'], // optional, defaults to all
  force: true // optional, forces full sync
});
```

### 2. Conflict Resolution (`ConflictResolver`)

Implements different strategies based on data type:

#### Session Conflicts
- **Strategy**: Latest timestamp wins
- **Logic**: Most recent modification takes precedence

#### Task Conflicts  
- **Strategy**: Preserve status progression
- **Logic**: Never go backwards in status (pending → submitted → approved → completed)
- **Status Priority**: Higher status values win unless explicitly reset

#### Settings Conflicts
- **Strategy**: Intelligent merging with user choice for conflicts
- **Logic**: 
  - System fields use latest timestamp
  - User preferences merge non-conflicting fields
  - Complex objects merge recursively where possible
  - Conflicting user preferences queue for manual resolution

### 3. Offline Queue (`OfflineQueue`)

Manages operations when offline:
- **Queuing**: Stores operations that can't be executed immediately
- **Processing**: Executes queued operations when back online
- **Retry Logic**: Implements exponential backoff for failed operations
- **Error Handling**: Moves permanently failed operations to error queue

### 4. Real-time Listeners (`FirebaseListeners`)

Provides immediate updates:
- **Collection Monitoring**: Listens for changes in Firebase collections
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies conflicts as they occur
- **Cache Invalidation**: Invalidates TanStack Query cache on updates

### 5. User Interface Components

#### SyncStatusIndicator
Shows current sync state:
- **Online/Offline Status**: Connection state indicator
- **Sync Progress**: Visual feedback during sync operations
- **Conflict Alerts**: Notifications when conflicts are detected
- **Last Sync Time**: Timestamp of most recent successful sync

#### ConflictResolutionModal
Interactive conflict resolution:
- **Side-by-side Comparison**: Local vs remote data display
- **User Selection**: Radio buttons for choosing resolution
- **Timestamp Display**: Shows modification times for context
- **Batch Resolution**: Resolves multiple conflicts at once

### 6. React Hooks and Context

#### useSync Hook
Manages sync state and operations:
```typescript
const { 
  isSyncing, 
  pendingConflicts, 
  sync, 
  resolveConflicts,
  lastSyncResult 
} = useSync();
```

#### SyncContext
Provides app-wide sync state:
- **Auto-sync**: Periodic background synchronization
- **Conflict Management**: Centralized conflict handling
- **Status Broadcasting**: Sync state available throughout app

## Data Flow

### 1. Normal Sync Operation
```
Local Changes → Pending Queue → Upload to Firebase → Mark as Synced
Firebase Changes → Download → Conflict Check → Apply Locally
```

### 2. Conflict Detection Flow
```
Local Change + Remote Change → Conflict Detected → Auto-Resolution Attempt
↓ (if auto-resolution fails)
Manual Resolution Queue → User Choice → Apply Resolution
```

### 3. Offline Operation Flow
```
User Action (Offline) → Offline Queue → Connection Restored → Process Queue → Sync
```

## Conflict Resolution Strategies

### Automatic Resolution

1. **Timestamp-based**: Latest modification wins (sessions)
2. **Status-based**: Higher status progression wins (tasks)  
3. **Field-level Merging**: Non-conflicting fields merge automatically (settings)

### Manual Resolution

When automatic resolution fails or isn't applicable:
1. Conflict is queued for user resolution
2. ConflictResolutionModal displays options
3. User selects preferred version
4. Resolution is applied to both local and remote

## Error Handling

### Sync Failures
- **Network Errors**: Operations queue for retry when online
- **Authentication Errors**: User prompted to re-authenticate
- **Permission Errors**: Logged and reported to user
- **Data Corruption**: Automatic recovery attempts with user notification

### Conflict Resolution Failures
- **Auto-resolution Errors**: Fall back to manual resolution
- **Manual Resolution Errors**: User notified with retry option
- **Persistent Conflicts**: Escalated to error queue for investigation

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- **Incremental Sync**: Only syncs changed data since last sync
- **Batching**: Groups multiple operations for efficiency
- **Compression**: Large payloads compressed before transmission
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching reduces redundant operations

### Monitoring
- **Sync Metrics**: Track success rates, conflict rates, sync times
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor batch sizes, queue lengths, resolution times
- **User Experience**: Track time to sync completion, user conflict resolution rates

## Integration Points

### TanStack Query Integration
- **Cache Invalidation**: Automatic cache invalidation on sync completion
- **Optimistic Updates**: Local updates reflected immediately
- **Background Sync**: Periodic background synchronization

### Firebase Integration  
- **Real-time Listeners**: Immediate notification of remote changes
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk operations using Firebase batching
- **Security Rules**: Proper access control and validation

### Dexie Integration
- **Transaction Management**: Atomic operations for data consistency
- **Index Optimization**: Efficient queries using proper indexes
- **Schema Evolution**: Handles database schema updates gracefully

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual component testing (ConflictResolver, OfflineQueue, etc.)
- Mock Firebase and Dexie dependencies
- Test all conflict resolution scenarios

### Integration Tests
