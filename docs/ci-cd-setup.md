## Workflow Configuration

### Automatic Triggers

The CI/CD pipeline runs automatically on:

- **Push to main/nightly**: Full deployment pipeline
- **Pull Requests**: Testing and quality checks
- **Scheduled runs**: Weekly security scans and quality reports
- **Manual triggers**: All workflows support manual execution

### Branch Strategy

- **nightly**: Development branch, auto-deploys to staging
- **main**: Production branch, auto-deploys to production
- **feature branches**: Run tests but don't deploy

## Google Sheets Setup

### Performance Data Sheet Structure
Create a sheet named "Performance Data" with these columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Timestamp | ISO timestamp of the audit |
| Commit | Git commit hash |
| Branch | Git branch name |
| Event Type | push, pull_request, schedule |
| Overall Score | Lighthouse overall score (0-1) |
| Performance Score | Performance category score |
| Accessibility Score | Accessibility category score |
| Best Practices Score | Best practices score |
| SEO Score | SEO category score |
| First Contentful Paint | FCP in milliseconds |
| Largest Contentful Paint | LCP in milliseconds |
| Cumulative Layout Shift | CLS score |
| Time to Interactive | TTI in milliseconds |
| Speed Index | Speed Index score |

### Code Quality Data Sheet Structure
Create a sheet named "Code Quality Data" with these columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Timestamp | ISO timestamp of the analysis |
| Commit | Git commit hash |

# Test Google Sheets (requires env vars)
node scripts/ci/google-sheets-helper.js performance '{"overallScore":0.85,"commit":"abc123"}'

# Test Discord notifications (requires webhook URL)
node scripts/ci/discord-reporter.js performance '{"overallScore":0.85,"isRegression":false}'
```

## Monitoring

### Health Checks

Monitor these indicators:
- ‚úÖ All workflows completing successfully
- üìä Regular data flowing to Google Sheets
- üîî Discord notifications being received
- üöÄ Deployments completing successfully

### Performance Baselines

Establish baselines for:
- **Performance Score**: Target ‚â• 80%
- **Code Quality Score**: Target ‚â• 85/100
- **Error Count**: Target ‚â§ 5 errors
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor for 10%+ increases

## Support

For issues with this CI/CD setup:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs first
2. Verify all required secrets are configured
3. Test integrations manually using provided scripts
4. Create GitHub issue with specific error details

## Security Considerations

- Never commit secrets to repository
- Use GitHub secrets for all sensitive data
- Regularly rotate API tokens and keys
- Monitor for unauthorized access in integrations
- Review security scan results weekly
