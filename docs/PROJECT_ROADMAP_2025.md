**Status: Actively in progress with organized sub-issues**

**Current State:**

- ESLint errors reduced from 398 to 354 problems (11% improvement)
- Hook architecture 63% complete (39/62 hooks implemented)
- Component logic separation strategy established

**Immediate Actions:**

- Complete 23 missing hooks across 4 implementation phases
- Resolve remaining 12 ESLint errors and 342 warnings through parallel work
- Finish business logic separation from components

**Why This is Now Priority #1:**
Stable architecture and clean codebase are prerequisites for reliable keyholder system implementation. The organized sub-issue structure enables parallel development by multiple contributors.

### 2. 🔐 Keyholder System (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Timeline: 8-10 weeks**
**Status: 3 concurrent implementations need consolidation**

This is the most critical feature distinguishing ChastityOS. Currently have:

- PR #143: Foundation with Dexie integration ✅
- PR #136: Advanced security and admin controls ✅
- PR #132: Complete Firebase architecture redesign ✅

**Immediate Action Required:**

- Consolidate the best features from all 3 approaches
- Target the advanced dual-account system with full keyholder controls
- Enable task/reward/punishment/rule management
- Real-time monitoring and session control

### 3. 🏗️ Architecture Stabilization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Timeline: 2-3 weeks** (reduced due to current progress)
**Status: Foundation complete, polish in progress**

**Completed:**

- ✅ TanStack Query migration
- ✅ Dexie offline database
- ✅ Component refactoring strategy established
- ✅ TypeScript improvements
- ✅ Logging system
- ✅ Hook architecture documented and organized
- ✅ ESLint cleanup strategy with sub-issues

**Remaining:**

- Complete 23 missing hooks (in progress via #232-235)
- Finalize Firebase sync service
- Polish TypeScript strict configuration

### 4. 🎨 UI/UX Modernization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Timeline: 3-4 weeks**
**Status: Design system in progress**

**Current Work:**

- Glass morphism design system (PR #150)
- Mobile-first responsive improvements
- Brand identity modernization

### 5. 📱 PWA & Performance (LOW PRIORITY)

**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**
**Status: Foundation exists, needs enhancement**

**Focus Areas:**
