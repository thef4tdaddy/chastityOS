# Tracker Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of integration and E2E tests for the Tracker/Chastity Tracking workflows.

## Tests Implemented

### 1. Integration Tests (Vitest)

#### Session Lifecycle Tests (`src/hooks/session/__tests__/sessionLifecycle.integration.test.ts`)

**Purpose**: Test the complete session lifecycle: start, pause, resume, end

**Test Coverage**:

- Starting a new chastity session
- Tracking session duration accurately
- Ending session and saving to history
- Preventing multiple active sessions
- Pausing an active session
- Tracking pause duration
- Resuming a paused session
- Accumulating pause time across multiple cycles
- Complete session workflow with multiple pauses
- Rapid state changes and timer synchronization

**Key Scenarios**:

- Session start → active for 30 min → pause 10 min → resume → active 45 min → pause 15 min → resume → active 35 min → end
- Multiple quick pause/resume cycles
- Real-time timer updates

#### Session History Tests (`src/hooks/session/__tests__/sessionHistory.integration.test.ts`)

**Purpose**: Test session history tracking and retrieval

**Test Coverage**:

- Saving completed sessions to history
- Retrieving sessions chronologically (newest first)
- Tracking pause events in history
- Calculating session statistics (avg length, completion rate, total time)
- Filtering sessions by date range
- Paginating session history
- Handling empty history
- Calculating goal achievement rates
- Tracking total chastity time
- Consistency scoring

**Key Features**:

- Pagination with configurable page size
- Date range filtering
- Statistics aggregation
- Performance optimization for large datasets

#### Multi-Device Sync Tests (`src/hooks/session/__tests__/sessionSync.integration.test.ts`)

**Purpose**: Test session synchronization across multiple devices

**Test Coverage**:

- Syncing session start across devices
- Syncing session pause/resume across devices
- Syncing session end across devices
- Handling concurrent updates from multiple devices
- Last-write-wins conflict resolution
- Preventing double-ended sessions
- Timer synchronization with tolerance
- Network interruption recovery
- Offline update queuing
- Sync performance and latency

**Key Scenarios**:

- Device A starts session → Device B sees session within 2s
- Device A pauses → Device B sees paused state
- Device A and B both try to pause simultaneously → consistent final state
- Network goes down → updates queue → network restored → sync completes

#### Keyholder Control Tests (`src/hooks/session/__tests__/keyholderControl.integration.test.ts`)

**Purpose**: Test keyholder-controlled session management

**Test Coverage**:

- Starting session with keyholder approval requirement
- Notifying keyholder on session start
- Starting with keyholder-assigned goals
- Keyholder ending submissive session
- Preventing submissive from ending session (hardcore mode)
- Keyholder pausing/resuming submissive session
- Extending session duration by keyholder
- Requesting keyholder approval for early end
- Handling approval/denial of early end requests
- Permission validation for keyholder actions
- Milestone notifications to keyholder

**Key Features**:

- Permission-based access control
- Approval workflow for early session end
- Keyholder override capabilities
- Notification system integration

#### Error Scenarios Tests (`src/hooks/session/__tests__/sessionErrors.integration.test.ts`)

**Purpose**: Test error handling, conflicts, and edge cases

**Test Coverage**:

- Database connection errors on session start
- Firebase errors during session updates
- Operation retry logic
- Concurrent operation conflict detection
- Concurrent pause/resume operations
- Preventing ending already-ended sessions
- Invalid state transitions (resume when not paused, pause when not active)
- Invalid goal duration validation
- Extremely long goal durations
- Missing required fields
- Session data corruption handling
- Very long session durations (30+ days)
- Multiple rapid pause/resume cycles
- Zero-duration pause handling
- Time boundary edge cases (midnight, DST)
- Resource cleanup on unmount
- Meaningful error messages

**Key Edge Cases**:

- Session duration at exactly goal boundary
- Rapid state changes (10 pause/resume cycles in 20 seconds)
- Network interruption and recovery
- Data corruption resilience

### 2. E2E Tests (Playwright)

#### Tracker Session Lifecycle E2E (`e2e/tracker-session-lifecycle.spec.ts`)

**Purpose**: Test complete chastity tracking workflow in the browser

**Test Coverage**:

- Starting a new chastity session in UI
- Displaying session statistics while active
- Displaying and updating session timer
- Ending an active session
- Pausing an active session with reason
- Displaying paused state indicator
- Resuming a paused session
- Displaying pause duration
- Navigating to session history page
- Displaying session history table
- Displaying session statistics
- Real-time statistics updates
- Handling rapid button clicks gracefully
- Session persistence across page reload
- Handling missing data gracefully
- Accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop viewports)

**Key User Journeys**:

1. User starts session → sees active timer → pauses → resumes → ends → views history
2. User starts session → reloads page → session restored
3. User navigates between tracker and history pages
4. Mobile user performs all operations on small viewport

**Accessibility Tests**:

- All buttons have text or aria-labels
- Keyboard navigation works
- Focus management
- Screen reader compatibility

**Responsive Tests**:

- Mobile viewport (375x667)
- Tablet viewport (768x1024)
- Desktop viewport (1920x1080)

## Test Metrics

### Coverage Goals

- **Integration Tests**: 85%+ coverage of session-related hooks
- **E2E Tests**: All critical user paths covered
- **Edge Cases**: 95%+ of known edge cases tested

### Test Performance

- Integration tests should run in <30 seconds
- E2E tests should run in <2 minutes per browser
- Sync latency tests validate <2 second sync time

## Running the Tests

### Integration Tests (Vitest)

```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm run test:unit

# Run specific test file
npm run test:unit src/hooks/session/__tests__/sessionWorkflows.integration.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:unit:coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:unit:watch
```

**Note**: Integration tests that interact with IndexedDB require `fake-indexeddb` to be properly configured in the test setup. Tests that don't require database operations (analytics, state checks) will pass. See `src/test/setup.ts` for global test configuration.

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run specific test
npx playwright test e2e/tracker-session-lifecycle.spec.ts

# Debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### All Tests

```bash
npm run test:all
```

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data

- Tests use isolated mock data per test case
- Mock timers for consistent time-based tests
- Mock Firebase for predictable data operations

### Cleanup

- Each test properly cleans up timers, subscriptions, and mocks
- `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks ensure clean state

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Test Scenarios

1. **Relationship Tests**: Test submissive/keyholder relationship changes during sessions
2. **Goal Progress Tests**: Test goal tracking and milestone notifications
3. **Emergency Unlock Tests**: Test emergency unlock workflow
4. **Session Recovery Tests**: Test recovery from app crashes
5. **Offline Mode Tests**: Test full offline functionality
6. **Performance Tests**: Load testing with many sessions
7. **Security Tests**: Test permission boundaries and data isolation

### Test Infrastructure

1. **Visual Regression Tests**: Screenshot comparison for UI changes
2. **API Contract Tests**: Validate Firebase/backend contracts
3. **Load Tests**: Test with 1000+ sessions in history
4. **Stress Tests**: Rapid operation sequences
5. **Mutation Tests**: Validate test quality with mutation testing

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation

1. Tests use mocked Firebase - may not catch real Firebase issues
2. Timer precision in tests may differ from production
3. Some E2E tests depend on specific UI text/selectors
4. Network simulation is basic (binary on/off)

### Areas for Improvement

1. Add real Firebase integration tests with emulator
2. Add more granular network failure simulations
3. Add tests for specific error messages
4. Add tests for analytics/telemetry
5. Add tests for session sharing/export features

## Maintenance

### Updating Tests

When updating session logic:

1. Update corresponding integration tests
2. Update E2E tests if UI changes
3. Update this documentation
4. Verify all tests pass before merging
