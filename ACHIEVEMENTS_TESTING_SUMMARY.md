# Achievement System Unit Testing - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive unit tests for the Achievement system's services and hooks as part of v4.0.0 polish initiative.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Achievement Helpers (30 tests - 100% coverage)
**File:** `src/utils/achievements/__tests__/achievementsHelpers.test.ts`

**Functions Tested:**
- `findAchievementById` - Find achievement by ID
- `checkHasAchievement` - Check if user has earned an achievement
- `findProgressForAchievement` - Get progress for specific achievement
- `filterAchievementsByCategory` - Filter achievements by category
- `filterUserAchievementsByCategory` - Filter user's achievements by category
- `calculateProgressPercentage` - Calculate completion percentage
- `mapAchievementsWithProgress` - Map achievements with progress data
- `getRecentAchievements` - Get recently earned achievements

**Edge Cases Covered:**
- Empty arrays
- Missing/undefined values
- Boundary conditions (0%, 100%, >100%)
- Decimal values
- Large numbers

### 2. Achievement Progress Service (19 tests)
**File:** `src/services/database/achievements/__tests__/AchievementProgressService.test.ts`

**Functionality Tested:**
- Creating new progress records
- Updating existing progress
- Progress completion detection
- Achievement awarding on completion
- Querying user progress
- Querying specific achievement progress

**Edge Cases Covered:**
- Zero progress values
- Negative values
- Very large numbers
- Decimal progress values
- Exact boundary conditions (currentValue === targetValue)
- Database errors
- Missing badge service

### 3. Achievement Engine (25 tests)
**File:** `src/services/__tests__/AchievementEngine.test.ts`

**Functionality Tested:**
- Engine initialization
- Session event processing (start/end)
- Session milestone detection
- Consistency badge tracking
- Streak achievement tracking
- Task completion achievements
- Task approval rate achievements
- Early task completion tracking
- Goal completion achievements
- Goal overachievement detection
- Special condition achievements:
  - Early morning sessions (before 8am)
  - Late night sessions (after 10pm)
  - Weekend sessions
  - Holiday sessions
  - New Year sessions
- Full achievement check (backfill)

**Edge Cases Covered:**
- Empty data sets
- Sessions without end times
- Achievements with no requirements
- Database errors
- Exact boundary values
- Already-earned achievements

### 4. useAchievements Hook (11 tests)
**File:** `src/hooks/__tests__/useAchievements.test.ts`

**Functionality Tested:**
- Loading all achievements
- Loading user achievements
- Loading achievement progress
- Loading notifications
- Achievement lookup by ID
- Checking if user has achievement
- Getting progress for achievement
- Filtering by category
- Achievement engine initialization
- Notification tracking

**Additional Testing:**
- `useAchievementNotifications` hook
- Unread notification counting
- Loading states

## Test Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tests | 85 |
| Passing Tests | 85 (100%) |
| Test Files | 4 |
| Helper Coverage | 100% |
| Edge Cases | 20+ scenarios |
| Mock Strategy | Firebase calls properly mocked |

## Mocking Strategy

All tests use proper mocking to avoid Firebase dependencies:

1. **Database Services:** Mocked using `vi.mock()` with factory functions
2. **Achievement Engine:** Mocked initialization and full check methods
3. **Query Client:** Created fresh instances for each test
4. **Dexie Tables:** Mocked with chainable query methods

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all achievement tests
npm run test:unit -- src/utils/achievements/__tests__ src/services/__tests__/AchievementEngine.test.ts src/services/database/achievements/__tests__ src/hooks/__tests__/useAchievements.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:unit:coverage -- src/utils/achievements/__tests__ src/services/__tests__/AchievementEngine.test.ts src/services/database/achievements/__tests__ src/hooks/__tests__/useAchievements.test.ts

# Run specific test file
npm run test:unit -- src/utils/achievements/__tests__/achievementsHelpers.test.ts
```

## Code Quality

- ✅ All tests follow existing patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive edge case coverage
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing code
- ✅ Proper TypeScript typing
- ✅ Clear test descriptions
- ✅ Isolated test cases
- ✅ Mock cleanup in beforeEach hooks

## Files Created

1. `src/utils/achievements/__tests__/achievementsHelpers.test.ts`
2. `src/services/database/achievements/__tests__/AchievementProgressService.test.ts`
3. `src/services/__tests__/AchievementEngine.test.ts`
4. `src/hooks/__tests__/useAchievements.test.ts`

## Integration

These tests integrate seamlessly with the existing test infrastructure:
- Uses Vitest as configured in `vitest.config.ts`
- Follows patterns from existing hooks tests
- Uses same mocking setup from `src/test/setup.ts`
- Runs in CI/CD pipeline with `npm run test:unit`

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for additional testing:
1. useAchievementMutations hook (toggle visibility, mark read)
2. Achievement notification components
3. Achievement gallery components
4. AchievementDBService (comprehensive database operations)
5. Integration tests with actual Dexie database
6. E2E tests for achievement flows
